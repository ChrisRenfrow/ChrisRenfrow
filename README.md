## Hello, World! 🌎🌍🌏

As a primarily self-taught software developer, I took my learning further while attending [42](https://42.fr/en/), a vocational school for software developers. I then spent the next 3 years working as a full-stack developer for several startups as an independent contractor. Now I am attending my first batch at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) where I'm learning about Rust and Embedded Systems!

- 🌱 **Currently learning:** Rust, Rust Embedded, Haskell
- 🛠️ **Working on:** 
  - [gol-lib](https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/gol-lib) - a Rust Game of Life library
  - [gol-midi](https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/gol-midi) - a program that encodes Game of Life board-state as MIDI signals
- 💬 **Talk to me about:** Emacs, Nix, Rust
