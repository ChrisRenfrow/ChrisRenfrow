## Hello, World! 🌎🌍🌏

As a self-taught software developer, I took my education further by attending [42](https://42.fr/en/), a vocational school for software developers. I then spent 3 years working independently as full-stack web-developer for several clients. Now I am attending my first batch at [The Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), an educational retreat for programmers, where I'm learning about Rust and Embedded Systems!

- 🌱 **Currently learning:** Rust, Rust Embedded, Haskell
- 🛠️ **Working on:** 
  - [gol-lib](https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/gol-lib) - a game of life library written in Rust
  - [gol-midi](https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/gol-midi) - a program that translates a game of life board-state into a MIDI controller
- 💬 **Talk to me about:** Emacs, Nix, Rust
