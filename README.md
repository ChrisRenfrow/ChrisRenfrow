## Hello, World! 🌎🌍🌏

As a self-taught software developer, I took my education further by attending [42](https://42.fr/en/), a vocational school for software developers. I then spent 3 years working independently as full-stack web-developer for several clients. Most recently I've attended my first batch at [The Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), an educational retreat for programmers, where I learned about Rust and Embedded Systems!
